# Introduction

Revealer Toolkit 2 (RVT2) is a framework for computer forensics. It is written in Python 3 and uses many open source tools like *The Sleuth Kit* or *regripper*.

RVT2 aims to automate rutinary tasks and analysis when managing forensic images, or *sources*. RVT2 is specially useful in an environment with many *cases*, many *sources* and many *analyzers*.

RVT2 was developed and it is continously used at [Incide Digital Data](http://www.incide.es), a Spanish DFIR company sited at the beautiful city of Barcelona. It is designed to run on a Debian stable version, althought it is possible to install it on other other GNU-Linux flavours.

This manual is the analyst/user manual of the RVT2. For a more in depth description of the modules, packages and classes in the RVT2, check the [Developers manual](https://incidedigital.github.io/rvt2/).
