RVT2 is developed and continously used in INCIDE, a Spanish DFIR company sited at the beautiful city of Barcelona (see [www.incide.es](http://www.incide.es) for more details). It is designed to run on a Debian stable version, althought it is possible to install it on other other GNU-Linux flavours.
